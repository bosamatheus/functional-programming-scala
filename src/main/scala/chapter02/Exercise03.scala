/**
 * Implement partial1 and write down a concrete usage of it.
 * There is only one possible implementation that compiles. We don't have any
 * concrete types here, so we can only stick things together using the local 'rules of
 * the universe' established by the type signature. The style of reasoning required here
 * is very common in functional programming â€” we are simply manipulating symbols
 * in a very abstract way, similar to how we would reason when solving an algebraic equation.
